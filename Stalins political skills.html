kept this position until his death in. Historians have disagreed on which factors mainly influenced this rise to power and how far his political skill was responsible for this. I will be primarily discussing three works published over a 40-year time period, with differing viewpoints on how he managed to do this The First viewpoint is known as intentionalism and is shown by Roy. A Medvedev in his work titled &lsquo;Let History Judge the Origins and Consequences of Stalinism&rsquo; Medvedev argues that Stalin found his position by utilising his political finesse, Medvedev and other intentionalist writers believe that Stalin used his personality and skill to rise to power. The second viewpoint I will focus on is known as Structuralism and is the view of Russian Historian Oleg Khlevniuk as seen in his 2015 book &lsquo;Stalin New Biography of a Dictator&rsquo; Structuralists such as Khlevniuk believe that Stalin managed to get to be the leader of the USSR primarily because of his position as General Secretary which became all important during the struggle for power. The third interpretation of why Stalin became leader of the USSR in 1929 is put forward in the book &lsquo;Stalin the first in-depth biography based on explosive new documents from Russia&rsquo;s secret archives&rsquo; by Edvard Radzinsky he shows how Stalin became leader of the USSR Primarily due to the failures and weaknesses of his political opponents. I will be discussing and analysing the authors I have mentioned interpretations of the question and then discuss my own beliefs on how Stalin managed to become the leader of the USSR by 1929 I personally take the view that Stalin managed to become leader of the USSR primarily &nbsp;by utilising his position: General Secretary to form a powerbase from which he could more tightly control party affairs as well as increase his influence at a time when the General Secretary became an all-important position in the party.</span></p><h1 class="c16" id="h.1fob9te"><span class="c6">First Interpretation</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The first School of thought I&rsquo;m going to discuss on how Stalin gained Primacy is known as intentionalism this is the idea that Stalin won against his opposition due to his personal qualities: manipulative and political skills, determination, and ruthlessness by these qualities Stalin managed achieve power by his own means. This idea is shown clearly by the soviet writer Roy Medvedev in his 1972 book &lsquo;Let History Judge&rsquo; Medvedev has written many works which criticise Stalin usually from his Marxist perspective. When &lsquo;Let History Judge&rsquo; was published Medvedev and many other intellectuals were trying to push a new reformist version of socialism meaning the book would be biased against Stalinism at a time when Soviet propagandists were trying to rehabilitate the former General Secretary, Because of the dissident viewpoint expressed by Medvedev being published abroad Medvedev was ejected from the Communist Party not joining back until 1989.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">From the first page Medvedev makes clear his viewpoint where it states &lsquo;Stalin displayed such great energy, organizational ability, and single minded will.&rsquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;From this alone it is clear Medvedev follows an intentionalist school of thought as Stalin is shown to be a skilled individual who would use these traits to gain power and influence.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Medvedev also discusses Stalin&rsquo;s time in the party shortly after the civil war he discusses Stalin&rsquo;s political skill in relation to Stalin&rsquo;s relationship to Lenin saying how he would often object to Lenin&rsquo;s policies but never join an official opposition group &lsquo;At the decisive moment he always withdrew his objections and invariably appeared among the majority. It is difficult to believe that this was due only to the persuasiveness of Lenin&rsquo;s arguments.&rsquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;From this it can be inferred Medvedev is saying Stalin would side with Lenin primarily to keep hold to the power he had this can be seen as political skill which goes in line with Medvedev&rsquo;s intentionalist views.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">During the chapter titled &lsquo;Stalin&rsquo;s struggle with the opposition&rsquo; Medvedev discusses Zinoviev&rsquo;s plan to use Stalin to his advantage &lsquo;Zinoviev aware of the mutual dislike between Stalin and Trotsky, assumed Stalin would be able to check Trotsky and open the way for his own rise to power&rsquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;because of this going against Lenin&rsquo;s proposal to remove Stalin from the position of General Secretary Medvedev shows how Stalin used this situation to his advantage due to his personality &lsquo;Stalin turned out to be much craftier than Zinoviev&rsquo; and goes onto explain Stalin&rsquo;s use of his position; from this alone we can see Medvedev&rsquo;s intentionalist viewpoint that Stalin was politically gifted and used his other traits to rise past his opposition.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">At the time where the General Secretary&rsquo;s position became increasingly important Medvedev shows Stalin as one of the few aware of these changes from which he cleverly formed a powerbase &lsquo;Stalin took clever advantage of these changes. Relying on the many &ldquo;fighters&rdquo; and &ldquo;practical&rdquo; people in the party, steadily encouraging their resentment against the preponderant &ldquo;theorists,&rdquo; Stalin also formed a bloc with the Bukharin&ndash;Rykov group in the Politburo. Thus when Trotsky&rsquo;s opposition was defeated in 1923-24, it was not Zinoviev but, rather surprisingly Stalin who acquired decisive influence in the CC.&rsquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;from this passage Medvedev shows explicitly Stalin&rsquo;s skill to use his positioning effectively by which he could create a powerbase which allowed him to have a huge amount of influence in the Central Committee the intentionalist viewpoint explains Stalin was able to do this due to the trait of being &lsquo;clever&rsquo; which Medvedev describes him to be once again showing how Medvedev believes Stalin used his political skill to become more powerful.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp; . </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Medvedev shows also surrounding happenings related to the Fourteenth party Congress Medvedev highlights Stalin&rsquo;s character by showing how he used the struggle with the &lsquo;New Opposition&rsquo; strengthening his power: &lsquo;Stalin used the intra-party struggle to strengthen his personal position and power.&rsquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Medvedev also comments on Stalin&rsquo;s actions after the victory of the Politburo majority: &rsquo;Stalin hastened to consolidate his victory over the &ldquo;new opposition&rdquo; by organizational measures,&rsquo; keeping Zinoviev and Kamenev in the Politburo but removing them from other positions to lessen their influence and weaken their personal power as Bolshevik Oligarchs once again Medvedev is commenting on Stalin&rsquo;s decision making among other personal traits and Political skill.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Regarding the &lsquo;Struggle with the opposition&rsquo; Medvedevs references how Stalin wished to destroy his opponents one at a time and use his cunning to deceive the party of his true goals which was to split the party and expel members who disagreed with him. &lsquo;Stalin sought to smash his political rivals completely and to establish one-man rule over the party&rsquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and &lsquo;he himself was a hypocrite who deceived the party and concealed his true goals. By first supporting Zinoviev and Kamenev against Trotsky, then Bukharin, Rykov and Tomskii against Zinoviev and Kamenev, Stalin did not unite the Party. He split it; he intensified existing disagreements, pushing toward the suppression and expulsion of those who disagreed with him.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Another Work which Shows an intentionalist viewpoint is Robert Service&rsquo; Stalin a Biography Written in 2004 this book is very clearly intentionalist and like Medvedev also shows a belief that at least partly Stalin became leader of the USSR due to his political skill; This is shown rather clearly when he is discussing Stalin in relation to the Thirteenth Party Conference &lsquo;He had the potential of a true leader. He was decisive, competent, confident and ambitious.&rsquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c7">&nbsp;Service then goes on to say how these qualities were &lsquo;understood by other Central Committee members&rsquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c7">&nbsp;who allowed Stalin to lead the Charge against Trotsky at the Thirteenth Party Conference.

However the Intentionalist school of thought does not focus much on the circumstances of the party as a whole making the view seem as though it leaves some things out. Damaging the persuasiveness of the viewpoint as a whole.</span></p><h1 class="c16" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c6">Second Interpretation</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The second school of thought which I will be discussing will be Structuralism the view that Stalin&rsquo;s rise to power was due to his position of General Secretary became all important giving him the ability crush his opposition and become leader in the events after the death of Lenin in 1924.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Explored in Oleg V.

After the oppositionists gathered out of sight of the authorities in June 1926 Stalin branded the group as an &lsquo;illegal organisation&rsquo; and Zinoviev was removed from the Politburo, by October 1926 Trotsky and Kamenev were also removed from the Politburo.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Khlevniuk makes it clear by 1927 there was negligible competition for primacy in the communist party as &lsquo;only one power hungry member remained in the Politburo: Stalin&rsquo; shows how Khlevniuk believes Stalin unstoppable by this point. He then summarises: &lsquo;In the pivotal post of general secretary, Stalin used the battle with the left opposition to strengthen his position. The Schism within the party permitted him to play the role of the preserver of Lenin&rsquo;s legacy and strengthened his control over the party apparat and state security. These advantages did not assure him victory, but they shifted the odds in his favour.&rsquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;From this summary it is very clear to see that Khlevniuk sees the fact the role of general secretary became all important as the main reason for his rise and success against his opponents in the struggle for power as it gave him a huge advantage.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c7">Another work in which the author shows a Structuralist view is Sheila Fitzpatrick&rsquo;s 2015 book titled &lsquo;On Stalin&rsquo;s Team the Years of Living Dangerously in Soviet Politics in which a Structuralist view is very clear as she describes how Stalin&rsquo;s position helped him gain the position of leader of the USSR this is shown first when she talks about the power Stalin had as General Secretary, &lsquo;Stalin had concentrated enormous power in his hands as the Party&rsquo;s General Secretary.&rsquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span class="c7">&nbsp; she also mentions how oppositionists to the party majority which was influenced by Stalin&rsquo;s control of the party at a low level were harassed out of making points allowing Stalin to become more powerful &lsquo;At Party congresses oppositionists were now mercilessly heckled.&rsquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;The fact this is what is primarily mentioned shows Structuralists Primarily belief the party structure to be the reason how Stalin became leader of the USSR </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In Conclusion the Structuralist view is clearly showing the position Stalin had as General secretary as the main reason for his rise to leader though it does seem like Stalin&rsquo;s political ability is referenced to an extent I also find the view rather persuasive as historians that follow it such as Khlevniuk reference many documents and events as well as this it is a belief that is not outdated post glasnost, like the school of thoughts many soviet writers have. </span></p><h1 class="c16"><span class="c6">Third Interpretation</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The view of Edvard Radzinsky is that the main reason for Stalin&rsquo;s success in the struggle for power against his opposition was the weaknesses and mistakes of his opponents especially Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev who in the mid to late 1920s made many mistakes that would allow Stalin to gain power and influence eventually leading to their expulsion from the Politburo and Stalin&rsquo;s single man unchallenged leadership of the USSR he show&rsquo;s this in his 1996 book titled &lsquo;Stalin The First in-depth biography based on explosive new documents from Russia&rsquo;s secret Archives.&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Radzinsky first criticises Trotsky following Lenin&rsquo;s death for believing he could gain primacy quickly &lsquo;His calculation no was that he could take the conference by storm.

Radzinsky clearly references this to show how the failure of the opposition as a reason for Stalin&rsquo;s continually increasing power starting in 1924. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Radzinsky then goes on to talk about how Trotsky was greatly weakened by the troika of Stalin, Kamenev, Zinoviev and puts the blame squarely on Trotsky himself showing how Trotsky&rsquo;s nature was what caused him this problem when referring to Trotsky&rsquo;s beliefs about the opposition he was facing he says &lsquo;he Trotsky was the October leader, that Zinoviev and Kamenev were cowards, that Stalin was simply irrelevant&rsquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><span class="c7">&nbsp;&lsquo;This was suicide.&rsquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp; This last comment is particularly helpful to infer how incompetent Trotsky was politically at this time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Radzinsky continually uses the weaknesses of Stalin&rsquo;s opponents to show how he got his power only also giving credit to the powerbase Stalin had built up with which he made his personal political enemies, oppositionist enemies to the Politburo &lsquo;Eminent Bolsheviks who had once been Lenin&rsquo;s comrades-in-arms and were know &ldquo;oppositionists.&rdquo; &rsquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span class="c7">&nbsp;this shows how due to Stalin&rsquo;s power base which he had created due to his position of General Secretary. Also on the topic of the oppositionists he highlights their failure (Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev) to see the reality of the situation they were in citing that they believed such prominent figures as themselves would win over the Party by a united presence alone: &lsquo; they suffered from the peculiar Russian disease of na&iuml;ve romanticism. They believed that the three of them only had to appear together and the Party would immediately remember the heroic past and fall in behind its former leaders. They refused to see that the membership had long been eating out of the new potentate&rsquo;s hand, that the overwhelming majority of majority of the bureaucrats who now managed the party had been installed by Stalin,&rsquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;this shows Stalin&rsquo;s opposition by this point was doomed to fail due to Stalin&rsquo;s changes he made as general secretary and more so due to their own failure to recognise the effects these changes would have had.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Radzinsky also talks about the effects of the underground press which was set up for oppositionists the underground activity was declared illegal by Stalin allowing for a purge of Trotskyists from the party and the expulsion of Trotsky and Zinoviev in November &lsquo;Trotsky was obliged to set up a underground press to print his program.&rsquo; </span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup><span class="c0">&lsquo;This is just what Stalin had been waiting for. The underground press became the excuse for the immediate expulsion of Trotsky&rsquo;s supporters from the party.&rsquo; This shows how Radzinsky again shows Trotsky&rsquo;s obligation to have an underground press would severely damage the oppositionists leading to its leaders being removed from power allowing for Stalin to consolidate his rule and end up leader of the USSR by 1929.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c0">My thoughts on the value of the work of Radzinsky is that it is fairly valuable being a contemporary non mainstream view and he has cited many sources though unlike other works it doesn&rsquo;t at all mention what other historians mention such as the personal qualities of Stalin or the fact that he had some form of political skill making it not as persuasive as for example Khlevniuk&rsquo;s work.</span></p><h1 class="c16"><span class="c6">Evaluation and Comparison of Viewpoints and Works and Conclusion as well as My Personal Opinion.</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The main three works I have read for this have all been informative and have offered very different points of view into how Stalin was able to become the leader of the USSR by 1929. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The first work of the main works I have mentioned was Medvedev&rsquo;s &lsquo;Let History Judge&rsquo; this book portrayed Stalin&rsquo;s character very negatively however what it did do was clearly show the authors view on how Stalin managed to become leader which was through his personal skills and traits from this Medvedev clearly believed that Stalin used his political skill to a strong extent to become leader of the USSR this intentionalist school of thought contrasts with the other two works sharply as they both had very different ideas of the primary reason which resulted in Stalin&rsquo;s primacy; Medvedev&rsquo;s books was also published before Glasnost so although it does not follow the mainstream soviet view of the early late 1960s and early 1970s Medvedev does not have all the information he could have had making his book less reliable than that of example Khlevniuk though the intentionalist view is not limited to soviet writers as seen in Service&rsquo; Biography of Stalin from 2004 I also found the scope of &lsquo;Let History Judge&rsquo; to be limited in regard to the struggle for power when compared to the other works I have read only really focusing on Stalin and the Bolshevik Oligarchs rather than the party as a whole which again when compared to Khlevniuk and even Radzinksky&rsquo;s work makes &lsquo;Let History Judge&rsquo; seem much more unreliable and less persuasive.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Khlevniuk being a structuralist primarily beliefs that the structure of the Party was the reason for Stalin becoming leader he explores this belief in his book &lsquo;Stalin New Biography of a Dictator&rsquo;; he and other Structuralists such as Fitzpatrick believe that Stalin holding the position of General Secretary gave him the advantage he needed to win the power struggle after the death of Lenin Structuralists attribute some of Stalin&rsquo;s success to his political skill they do not believe that Stalin relied on luck as much as he relied on the position to create a powerbase which he could use to his advantage, what makes the Structuralist view so persuasive is that it is very common post Glasnost meaning many of the more contemporary authors that use this argument are knowledgeable to documents that for example soviet writers like Medvedev weren&rsquo;t as well as this the view explores lots of the politics sounding the party and not just what effected Stalin it can also be argued however that the Structuralist view found in Khlevniuk&rsquo;s work unjustifiably gives too much credit to Stalin&rsquo;s skill especially when compared with the revisionist view that it was a social and cultural change in the new party membership that allowed Stalin to become leader downplaying the importance of his political skill.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Radzinsky believed in the idea that Stalin&rsquo;s opposition&rsquo;s failure was the main reason for his success in the power struggle as shown in his book and after the fall of the main Bolshevik oligarchs of Trotsky, Kamenev and Zinoviev he had no real opposition and because of this he essentially relied on luck to get into power although Radzinsky does cite a lot of information I believe he focuses on the wrong things his view is much less persuasive than Khlevniuk&rsquo;s or Medvedev&rsquo;s view due to the fact he seems to completely ignore Stalin&rsquo;s own skill that clearly helped him off the back of the failure of his opponents as well as the powerbase Stalin managed to acquire; more so than Khlevniuk&rsquo;s work Radzinksky&rsquo;s book is contrasted by the revisionist view as seen in Trotsky&rsquo;s work titled &lsquo;A Revolution Betrayed&rsquo; where Trotsky focuses on the change of the views of the membership being the main reason for the success of Stalin in the power Struggle as he was the only old Bolshevik that would help them in their &lsquo;narrow minded view&rsquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;as he explains &lsquo;every revolution &hellip; has been followed by a counter revolution&rsquo; meaning that a change in the soviet view was the main reason for Stalin&rsquo;s eventual position as leader rather than luck even this view which doesn&rsquo;t take into account internal politics seems to me personally more persuasive than the view of Radzinsky.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">My personal view is that Stalin becoming leader was primarily due to the importance and all powerful nature that the position of General Secretary gave him with this he was able to form a powerbase which allowed him to control the views of the Party &nbsp;allowing him to isolate his opposition and eventually become leader I mostly follow a structuralist view as shown in Khlevniuk&rsquo;s work with liberal/intentionalist elements also, I believe that Stalin used his political skill to manipulate events such as the Fourteenth Party Conference and destroy his opposition. I disagree with Radzinksky&rsquo;s view which primarily focused on the mistakes of Stalin&rsquo;s opponents as it contrasts heavily with my personal view as well as this I think Medvedev&rsquo;s view focused on Stalin personally too much as that book was designed primarily to focus on Stalin&rsquo;s personal traits which isn&rsquo;t entirely congruent with the power struggle when compared to the structuralist view, however I equally disagree with some elements of the structuralist view as it seems to downplay any effect Stalin&rsquo;s opposition would have had and it is very hard to argue that figures such as Trotsky, Kamenev and Zinoviev didn&rsquo;t provide enough opposition to make it so Stalin could just ignore them with his position of General Secretary so it makes more sense that it only &lsquo;shifted the odds in his favour&rsquo; in the words of Khlevniuk.</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c14">Bibliography</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.1t3h5sf"><span class="c12">Books</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Elleinstein Jean, The Stalin Phenomenon, Lawrence &amp; Wishart Ltd, 1976</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">*Fitzpatrick Sheila, On Stalin&rsquo;s Team The Years of Living Dangerously in Soviet Politics, Princeton University Press, 2015</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">*Khlevniuk Oleg V., Stalin New Biography of a Dictator, Yale University Press, 2015 </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">McCauley Martin, Stalin and Stalinism, Longman, 3 edition 21 Mar. 2003</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">*Medvedev Roy A., Let History Judge the Origins and Consequences of Stalinism, Alfred A.
